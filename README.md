## Exploratory Data Analysis

---

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypothesis, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

Here are the EDAs I tried to conduct on [Air Quality](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/airquality) data (using R Studio) and [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) data (using Python) both the traditional way using the summary/description of the data and the simple and fast way using packages that create HTML files containing the results of EDA.
